# Flickr Excercise

###Task: 

Build a flickr app that fetches images from IBM's Flickr account using the API below and displays them. You are welcome to use any technology
to build it and design the layout in anyway that you see fit. An example of design is posted below but is in no way prescriptive on how it must look.
Once you have created your app, you would place it in your repository and provide a link to it.

What we are looking for:

 - Choice of design, layout and intuitiveness of interface.

 - Responsiveness across various form factors. For instance, mobile, tablet and desktop

 - Page load times and performance.

 - Browser compatibility on current release, current release-1 versions of browsers

 - Sorting and or filter options.

 - Use of source control to store code.
